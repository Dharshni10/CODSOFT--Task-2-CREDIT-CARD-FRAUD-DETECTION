# CODSOFT--Task-2-CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
This repository contains my Credit Card Fraud Detection project developed during the CodSoft internship. The project utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Key aspects include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, with a focus on achieving high accuracy and reducing false positives. Implemented in Python using scikit-learn and pandas, this project demonstrates practical skills in fraud detection with machine learning.

## Project Details
### Data Preprocessing:
The dataset includes various features related to credit card transactions. Initial steps involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing features to ensure the model works effectively.
Feature engineering is applied to extract relevant characteristics that improve the modelâ€™s performance.

### Model Building:
A Decision Tree Classifier is used to classify transactions as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent. The decision tree model makes predictions by learning decision rules from the training data.
The model is trained using a labeled dataset, where transactions are marked as fraudulent or legitimate.

### Model Evaluation
The performance of the Decision Tree Classifier is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision,and F1-score. These metrics help in understanding how well the model is distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

## Tools and Technologies
Python: For data manipulation and model development.
scikit-learn: Provides tools for building and evaluating the Decision Tree Classifier.
pandas: Used for data processing and manipulation.

## Purpose
The project aims to provide a practical solution for detecting fraudulent transactions, helping financial institutions reduce the risk of fraud and protect their customers. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can enhance security in financial transactions.
